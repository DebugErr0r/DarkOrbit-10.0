### DarkOrbit 10.0
#### [!] Based on an extended source code of the Base 10.0 emulator, I will add new things and fix bugs in the source code to create a non-shitty server with a bright future.

### What is the aim of this project ?
#### [!] To show everyone that with a lot of time and patience (and without 300€ bug-infested server files) you can create a non-shitty P-Server that is not about money, but about connecting players and creating a nice community.

### Will this be open source ?

#### [!] No, because if you really want to have a private server that is successful, you can do it without “better” files and make your own corrections. And I don't want to see some stupid skid selling my work to the next one for 300€.
